Building libvpx:

References: http://www.webmproject.org/code/build-prerequisites/

1. Git mirror of code repository https://github.com/webmproject/libvpx/,
2. Make a directory called "build" at the same level as the source tree extracted in 1,
3. Download YASM from http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html (libvpx state version 0.8 is required, download yasm-0.8.0-win64.exe). Copy exe into the "build" directory created in step 2 and rename the .exe to yasm.exe,
4. Open up cygwin and go to the build directory and run: ../libvpx-v1.3.0/configure --target=x86_64-win64-vs14 (to get a list of targets use ./libvpx-v1.3.0/configure --help),
5. The command in 4 builds Makefile. For some reason the file was created with me with all permissions removed. I manually added Full Control to Everyone and then ran make,
6. make failed becuase msbuild was not in my path. Added "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\12.0\bin" to the path,
7. make failed with an error about the obj_int_extract.bat command failing. Had to manually add Everyone Full Access permissions to ./build/obj_int_extract.bat,
8. RUnning make worked but attempting to build the VS solution still failed.
